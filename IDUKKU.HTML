      <p>Idukki is a district in the Indian state of Kerala. It was constituted on <br>
        26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division<br>
         was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki <br>
         district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala.<br>

        Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population <br>
        density among the districts of Kerala,the urban population being higher than the rural. Idukki is rich <br>
        in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".<br>
