        Kollam is an old seaport and city on the Laccadive Sea coast of the Indian state of Kerala.<br>
         It is situated 66 kilometers north of the state capital Trivandrum.The city is on the banks of <br>
         Ashtamudi Lake. Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians<br>
          and Romans. Fed by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the <br>
          five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.Desinganadu's rajas exchanged <br>
          embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam.
