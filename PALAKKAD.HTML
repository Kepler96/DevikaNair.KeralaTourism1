        Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern India. The 18th-century
        <br> Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North, 
        <br>on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous 
        <br>Ratholsavam chariot festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock 
        <br>garden created from recycled materials.
