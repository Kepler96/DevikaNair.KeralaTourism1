        Kozhikode also known as Calicut, is an Indian city, second-largest urban<br>
         agglomeration in the State of Kerala and 19th largest in the country with a population<br>
          of 2 million according to 2011 census.<br>

During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices<br>
for its role as the major trading point of Indian spices. A historical city, it was the capital<br>
 of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages. According to data<br>
  compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, <br>
  Kozhikode ranked as the second best city in India to reside in.
